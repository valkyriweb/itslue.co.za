## Trying to Reflect on my inner thoughts.

Taking the first steps, to sharing my journey. I'm not much of a writer, am I projecting my insecurities in my writing too?

I have decided to start this blog, to learn more about Gatsby as a system, and to share some of my thoughts and thinkings.

Tinkerings, learnings and experiences.

It is all new to me, but we shall start somewhere.

Learning the formatting for Markdown, a basic mark up language.
