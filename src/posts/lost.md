Overwhelmed.

Confused.

Unsure.

Insecure.

Why do I feel like this sometimes? I let the world get to me, the over thought of everything.
I am my own worst enemy. With all the support and belief. I am still doubt myself and my capabilities. What I bring to the this weird and wonderful globe.

I forget to ground myself in reality, dwelling on the past, present and soon to be future.

Life is filled with joy, love, fear, disappointment, passion, dispair, adventure, stability.
Up and down we go, fighting the balance in our minds, self aware and oblivious.

Have I become overly aware and overly concerned, how I long to be blissfully naive.

Yet with the awareness comes compassion and empathy. I love with all I have, and it came seem over bearing at times, yet I hope to never let the flame die.

Have all of me. The world deserves it, not all, yet all I can touch.

I will make mistakes. I will fail along the way. And I shall learn. Grow older. Wiser. Empathetic. And more shall I give.

A lot of "I"'s. Figuring out my place. Purpose and value.
Building the self esteem and confidence and discovering myself.

Soon it shall be more you. You. you.

Until I figure out I, eye shall stay.
