The odds are stacked, heavily against me. It feels this way sometimes.
I have run out of energy, feeling flat and defeated. I see there is a fraudelent transaction that has been going off on my card.
Im not sure from where.

I am already struggling. Exhausted trying to make ends meet. But I will not give up, we keep working towards the vision of a better day :).
