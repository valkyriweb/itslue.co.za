# Lust.

&nbsp;

### I've come to the realisation of why I enjoy sex so much.

It's an experience that fills my mind with sensations. I forget the chaos and storm I live in, and my mind is filled with an experience that I am addicted to.

I feel my heart racing, the way you kiss me and grab my neck pulling me into you. I grab your waist and grip on for dear life. Your lips are soft and your teeth grip my bottom lip as you gently tug it away from me. I open my eyes for a moment and we lock eyes for a moment between the lust, my heart explodes. The air is still, the sound of our lips exchanging words is like a soundtrack to the night. The sheets glide across your elegant arm as you grab my arms, I pull you closer to me, as close as I can.

I grip your thigh and pull you closer to me, our bodies intertwined. I want to kiss you everywhere, and I will, a form of admiration. A sign of respect for who you are, and what you deserve, love across your elegant body in the form of a kiss. Gentle and soft. I see the goosebumps form on your skin, I hold your chin and direct you towards me as we kiss again. I wish this moment could last forever.

I kiss your cheek gently, as I move to your eye and kiss you once on the eyelid, and bite your ear and you gasp for air. Holding your hair and head in one hand as I move and grip your hip with the other.

Biting your neck as I kiss my way down to your collar bone, I can smell your skin, your smell is mesmerizing. As my mind fills with the sensation of you, as you grab my hair and tug slightly while I pull your t-shirt up to kiss your stomach.

I lick your stomach from your belly button to your ribs just below your breast. We sit up as you ask me to help you remove your top, and your bra. I pause for a few seconds to admire you, our eyes lock, you relax as you reveal yourself and realise I am in awe of what I see. Vulnerable and you lean into me, we lock lips again as you lift my t-shirt, I voluntarily lift my arms while you kiss me. I grab you again as soon as I can and pull you into me. I feel your nipples against my chest moving as we fall into the bed again and we grip each other. I feel safe with you and my heart races with excitement. We lock our hands and you squeeze my hand with your fingers as I pull your hand up next to where your head rests.

You wrap your legs around me while I hold myself over your body, we touch as our bodies slide up and down while you kiss me and bite my neck. I move downwards again and my heart races, happiness and with butterflies filling my stomach I grab your left breast and squeeze. You release a slight moan in satisfaction as you inhale again, and I bite your right nipple and pull firmly. 

I gasp for a breathe as I say - "You are beautiful", as you hear your name you grab me and pull me up to you so we can kiss again. We make eye contact again, your eyes jump between my left and right eye as you process the sensations. You bite my lip this time harder than before. It hurts but it excites me even more, I kiss your chin, nose, forehead, any part of your body that I can. You pull yourself into me and I drop a little closer to you, you grab my arms that are tense as my shoulders and back hold my body up against yours. I feel your fingers run down my triceps as you feel my muscle, you grab and kiss me with all you have. You grab my lower back with your other hand and sink your nails in. It feels incredible, you pull my abdomen into yours with your legs and lock your legs together. I am locked in.

As you move your arms down to grab my groin with both hands. You undo the button of my jeans and I feel the tension relieved as they burst open. I grab your right breast this time and my eyes take in everything as I move down to your belly button again. Taking note of the beauty spots on your body, a map of you. I kiss your arms and move back to your stomach. I pause at your belly button as I kiss one by one, slowly down towards your jeans. I keep going, kissing firmly against your groin and you lift the heart of your feminity to greet my lips. I bite gently as I can just feel your lips underneath. I slowly pull your pants off and kiss your inner thighs, and you grab my head and squeeze with a gasp for air. Bliss. You lift your legs one by one and point your toes as I remove your jeans. 

I throw them behind me, and climb in to kiss you again, we grab each other and roll to the side as we do so. I feel my heart skip a beat as I fill with emotion and sensations, my body tingles down to my toes. You pull my jeans down and grab my ass and squeeze, I remove my jeans too. You run your right hand down my left arm, gripping my forearm for a moment. We make out for a few minutes as we take turns in exploring each other's mouths with our tongues. Our groins gently thrusting against each other's. I still have my jocks on, as your panties are on too. You pull me up against you again and slide up and down as you feel my erection on your labia. Gently rubbing your clitoris, I feel a pulse jolt through me, we are both frozen in a moment, holding each other's hands as you feel the weight of me holding myself up in your hands. Our eyes lock again. This time we gaze into each other's souls for a brief moment while our lips touch. We both pause, I lift myself slightly to see your whole face and take in all your beauty. "Don't look at me like that Luke". "I can't help it, you are perfect" I reply. Taking it all in and cementing this moment in my memory.

I feel you lift your hips slightly and you clench your abs as you slowly press yourself against my erection. Still covered by our last bit of clothing, a tease for what we both desire. You bite my shoulder and kiss my collar bone.

I slowly pull your panties down your hip bone. I kiss your breasts and make a path between them with my tongue as I remove your panties and toss them away. You grab my dick and squeeze firmly through my jocks, and you lift up slightly as you get up to remove my last bit of clothing. I won't let you just yet as push you back down and kiss the side of your ribs again and make my way down to your hip bone. I bite again and slowly kiss my way towards the top of your mound. I bite again and you squeeze my shoulders with your open legs and grip the pillow behind your head with one hand while grabbing my jaw with your other hand. You push me up and force mme to remove my jocks. The last barrier between our nudes bodies, another moment of vulnerability we share.

I kiss your lips and look up to see your reaction, as you bite your bottom lip and turn your head to the side in pleasure. I grab either leg and thrust my tongue up against your clitoris and you let out a combination of a gasp, scream and moan all in one.  I split your lips open slightly as I lick upwards with my tongue firmly pressing against your pussy.

You pull my head up, commanding me in a way to kiss you again, my elbows just above your shoulders, we bond together, lost in time. I feel my body fill and my nervous system is overloaded as I take it all in. Shooting sensations across my body. This could last forever. We lock eyes again and you smile slightly as I smile in return, I lift my face up a little and pause again as I admire your beauty. I look down to see your perfect breasts and I just see the outline of your nipples and stomach in the darkness of the night.

You lift my distracted face to face you again with your elegant hand as we kiss slowly again. I feel your lips firm against mine and close my eyes slowly with pure happiness. You reach down to grab my dick again and squeeze with excitement, I feel your whole body flinch, as you pull me towards you. I feel your soft pussy against my hard dick, and you coat the tip of my penis with your wet pussy. In preparation for the moment we are both ready for.

I slowly press my dick up against your wet lips while we kiss, you reach to hold both my hands and we lock our fingers, I move back slightly and press again as I feel your tight lips give way as they grip my dick. You moan and your eyes roll back and you gasp for air, it makes my dick throb as I press slowly all the way in. You bump your stomach against mine as you feel all of me. More than you expected? you wrap your arms around me and lift yourself slightly off the bed and I feel your head next to mine as I hear the air rush out of your mouth. You feel incredible as I feel my dick consumed by you, tingling across my whole body, and a slight shake at my lips as they tingle against your soft cheek, we kiss again with our souls tethered. An exchange of passion and lust.

I start to slowly thrust up and down as you hastily grab my hands again. I see a different look in your eyes as we start to kiss again, more passion as we lose ourselves in the moment. My heart bursts again, I have never felt anything like this before.

I slowly speed up as I feel your pussy grip my dick, and I push up and lift my hips slightly as our groins meet, gently pressing my groin up against your clit. And pressing your head into the head board.

"Oh my god Luke, what are you doing to me?". "You are perfect in every way." - I whisper into her ear, we let go of each other's hands as I use one hand to hold myself up and the other to pull you closer to me, grabbing your perfect ass. Your nails sink into my back and you slowly scrape downwards, I didn't think it was possible for you to turn me on even more. Pure lust takes over me as I start to fuck you harder, and I can just hear the sound of the skin between my dick and your pussy rushing past each other. I want to make your toes curl, I feel I must. I pull my dick as far out as it can go, before thrusting inwards till our groins meet again and your legs stiffen up and your back arches.

I cannot comprehend all the sensations I am feeling, but it is pure bliss and I am in a state of ecstasy. You turn quickly to bite the pillow and drown out the moans of pleasure. I feel your body tense up as I thrust back and forth, you grab my forearms again on either side and pull up to let me know that you want to hold hands again.

![peak](../images/lust/peak.jpg)

We kiss passionately as your hands squeeze mine as hard as you can, and I feel as your vagina squeezes my dick almost stopping my thrusting as you do so. And in a moment your body shakes and you let go of all the tension you have been holding, as you fail to hold back a moan of pure pleasure. Your feet curl and your body twists and turns filled with a moment pure pleasure. I can feel your ejaculation as you reach the peak of your orgasm and I feel your body quiver as you slowly relax and your orgasm ends. Your eyes rest and return to their normal position and you slowly open your eyes again fully while letting your legs fall down to the bed. Your head falls into a bed of hair, and you look at me with eyes filled with love, joy, and a sense of calm. Temporary paradise on earth. I hope I have satisfied you, even if just for a moment.

I pause for a moment to kiss you with pure love and happiness. You grab my cheeks and ears and pull me in to kiss for a few seconds, my head swirling with emotions. I grab your head just behind your ear and squeeze as I press my lips firmly into yours.

**Can this moment never end?**

A flutter in my stomach, <span style="text-shadow: 0px 2px 3px rgb(255, 255, 255, 0.7);">*I'm floating*</span>. 

It feels as if a piece of my soul is jumping across our lips to connect with a kiss to you.

These are moments that we live to remember, some of the good ones, mixed in to remind us in the darkness that there is light. There is serenity to be found in you.
