Her name was Jessica, she met my ex-girlfriend named Jessica.

![her](../images/her.jpg)

A girl in my dreams, it was weird as I observed the interaction, but it felt like Déjà vu.

Our minds are complex, intricate and fascinating. We imagine fantastical scenarios in our minds.

Her name was Jessica last night. The girl in my dreams, looming. 

Her confidence was attractive. Sure of herself. Calm and coherent. Balanced. I smiled as I watched her talk, her teeth were perfect, wearing lips made to love.

I have never seen her face, I feel the presence of her eyes gazing upon me. The touch of her lips when we kiss.

Yet I have no idea what her she looks like. I wish I could meet her out of curiosity.

Why has my mind imagined up this figure?
