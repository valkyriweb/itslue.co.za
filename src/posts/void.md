<h1 style="margin: 1rem 0;">Empty insides</h1>

Hollow, empty, void. I am.

Echoes fill the cavity inside.

Craving a feeling, meaningless thoughts fill my mind, 

I can't focus anymore.
Worried about it all, can I change my circumstances?

Of course I can, do I want to though?

I miss the warmth at my side, hold me close, fill my cavities with your love.

Don't empty yourself for me, it's selfish cravings, I will fill the cavity myself.

I will make myself whole for you.

Is the carcass still warm, will it light again? If I fill it up, will it leak?

Am I still in the cocoon or have I escaped, not aware of the change that has taken place.

Love I will still.

The butterfly, flies still, swiftly through the rain, I won't stop dancing.

I'm all over the place, but soon I will arrive where I need to be.

I check my phone frequently, does anyone want me still, for reasons other than work.

Unfortunately not, let the robot slave on some more, a little more, a lot more, too much more.

No more.
