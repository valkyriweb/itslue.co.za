<h1 style="margin: 1rem 0;">Eyes so deep, I could drown in them</h1>

Her eyes are haunting, they seem to carry mystery and pain.

Do you mind if I call you eyes from now on?

I want to fall into them, to escape the world I found myself in. But also to be with her forever, can I lose myself in your world.

The thought of what lies behind your eyes is terrifying, what do you think of me, of everything.
Is my self-esteem crying out for acceptance again, how childish.

Love fills my heart, I haven't felt it in a while, and it stirs a pain in my chest. My breath is heavy, the realisation is setting in, I love you for who you are and everything that I come to know.
An innocent love, with no other ill intent or selfish desire.

Selfish thoughts begin to find their way into my mind and I come to realise that I cannot control anything, but instead be grateful and enjoy the moments I have.

Thumping in my chest as the adrenaline kicks in and I realise, just because I am a good person and have a pure heart, it does not mean I will find a romantic love.

The loneliness returns with a wave of anxiety and low self-esteem. Can I not be stronger than this?

How disappointing life is sometimes, yet I bury myself in doubt and disbelief. I won't find anything inside of this hole of mine.

How attractive.

Distracted I carry on about myself again, I'm not sure whether my writing is meaningful, however it is an escape from my mind and a place to put my thoughts, so I can let them leave my mind.

Her eyes are dreamy, yet I'm uncertain what they hold, curiosity kicks in and I stare deep into the glistening orbs.
I feel safe, someone to comfort me and to exist with. This is reality, I feel alive again, and she brings life to the world.
Curiosity fills her mind, and she asks questions with intrigue in her eye. 

I miss her.

Her company, spectacular eyes and dreamy smile.

Look into my soul and let me dive into yours.
