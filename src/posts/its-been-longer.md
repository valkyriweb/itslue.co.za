<h1 style="margin: 1rem 0;">Am I still me?</h1>

Who am I? Wandering astray, I am.

Almost a year later, I've neglected me, I think it's for a better cause. Time reveals the cracks in the walls of my mind.

Who is, we? You are.

Entranced by the music of the rain. The bitter frost and cold, bites my empty mind. Ears flapping in the wind.

It's been a long first two quarters. My language has changed, emotionless and business like. Can I recognise myself?

Mask the pain and sorrow with laughter and smiles. Smile for me, you wonderful individuals. Your growth keeps me strong and in your rise I thrive.

Stay strong, feel the roots you have sown for yourself, you will be an inspiration for others soon. 

# Inspire you, foremost.

Lue
